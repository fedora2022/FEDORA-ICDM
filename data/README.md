# Pre-processed data
This directory contains the pre-processed data for our experiment.

The data for Semtab2019 is contained in semtab.zip, you need to first unzip it and then use it.

The data for Webtables is contained in the directory named [sato](./sato/).

Please adjust the path according to the codes in [scripts](https://github.com/fedora2022/FEDORA-ICDM/tree/main/scripts), if needed.

If you want to process the raw data by yourself, please check the following:

Link to [Webtables dataset](https://github.com/megagonlabs/sato/tree/master/table_data).

We have pre-processed the two datasets into .jsonl format in [data](https://github.com/fedora2022/FEDORA-ICDM/tree/main/data) directory. If you want to test FEDORA on other datasets, you can follow the /jsonl format stored and modify the experimental scripts accordingly.
