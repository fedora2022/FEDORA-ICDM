# FEDORA

This is the directory for FEDORA: **F**unctional-d**E**pen**D**ency-enhanced c**O**lumn semantic type annotation f**RA**mework.

## Requirements

We suggest using Anaconda to set up the enviroment needed for FEDORA.

Python version used is python 3.6.13. Please check the requirements.txt file in the directory to install all the required packages.

## Datasets

The datasets used in our paper are [Semtab 2019](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/2019/#datasets) and [Webtables](https://github.com/megagonlabs/sato/tree/master/table_data). We have pre-processed the datasets into .jsonl format in [data](./data) directory. If you want to test FEDORA on other datasets, you can follow the /jsonl format stored and modify the experimental scripts accordingly.
