# Extracting FDs

We adopt the open source implementation for TANE to extract FDs. You can check some [existing implementations](https://github.com/nabihach/FD_CFD_extraction) on github to perform this task.

We provide a [sample code](./FD_extractor.py) here for your reference. The input is the table files in .csv format.
